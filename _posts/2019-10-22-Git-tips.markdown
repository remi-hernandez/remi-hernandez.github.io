# Git Stash

From man git-stash :  
> show [<stash>]
       Show the changes recorded in the stash as a diff between the stashed state and
       its original parent. When no <stash> is given, shows the latest one. By default,
       the command shows the diffstat, but it will accept any format known to git diff
       (e.g., git stash show -p stash@{1} to view the second most recent stash in patch
       form).
       
To list the stashed modifications :   
`git stash list`

To show files changed in the last stash :  
`git stash show`

So, to view the content of the most recent stash, run :  
`git stash show -p`

To view the content of an arbitrary stash, run something like :  
`git stash show -p stash@{1}`

Delete a stash :  
`git stash drop stash@{n}`  

Apply a stash :  
`git stash apply stash@{0}`
