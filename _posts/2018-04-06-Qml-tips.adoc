In an item (A) which handle the position of his sons (B) (e.g.: a RowLayout), if you do this the son's position management will be broken.

In this example the rectangle B is used to do a background but the right solution is to put this rectangle at the root, as a parent of the RowLayout.

[source,javascript]
----
RowLayout {
 	id: A
    Rectangle {
    	id: B
        anchors.fill: parent // don't do this !
        color: "red"
    }
    
    Rectangle {
    	id: BB
    }
    
    Rectangle {
    	id: BBB
    }
}
